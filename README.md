**HYPOTHYROID PREDICTIVE MODEL**

**RESEARCH QUESTION**

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

**METRICS FOR SUCCESS**

Create a predictive using two advanced decision trees to Random forests, Ada boosted trees or gradient boosted trees and optimize to get accurate results.

Apply Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build your SVM model.

The models should have an accuracy greater than 80%.

**UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT**

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to create a predictive model.

**EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN**

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.

Performing regression analysis as a base model.

Create a model based on decision trees.

Create a model based on SVM.

Conclusion.
